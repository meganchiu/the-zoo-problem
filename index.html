        <p>
          Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are
          classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight
          species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide
          variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and
          partially in the Southern Hemisphere.
